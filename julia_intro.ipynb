    "## Collatz conjecture\n",
    "Given a positive integer, create a function that counts the steps it takes to reach `1` following the [Collatz conjecture algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) (if $n$ is odd do $n=3n+1$ otherwise do $n=n/2$ until you reach 1). Test it with the number 100 to get 25. Ensure that your function is type stable by calling `@code_warntype your_function(100)` and getting no red text.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: make a type-stable function by using `÷`, (`\\div<TAB>`): In Julia `/` is the floating point devision operator and thus `n/m` is always a float number even if `n, m` are integers.*\n"
